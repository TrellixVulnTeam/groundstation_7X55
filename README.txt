Code for the ground station.

Follows an MVC structure.


Notes:

The GUI will be coded using the Kivy framework.  It has support for Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS and Android; it also has support for multi-touch if that's something we want to implement later.  It claims that the same code can be used on all of the platforms, no changes.
