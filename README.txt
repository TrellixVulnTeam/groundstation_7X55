Code for the ground station 


Notes:

The GUI is coded with PySide and PyQt.  The framework is stable, mature and cross-platform, and .  Any machine with the proper plug-ins installed (installation package can be created).  To edit the program, you will need to download Qt (free version available, just google it), pyside libraries (requires python 3.4 or lower); some instructions here http://wiki.qt.io/PySide_Binaries_Windows .
